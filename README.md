# javaGUItoolkit
A cross-platform JAVA GUI toolkit with concrete MVC support

The Java Interaction
Separation Toolkit (JIST) was developed with the intention
of having a lightweight, cross-platform and support for a
declarative UI. By using the WORA aspect of Java most of
the desktop platforms are covered. It features XML support
for describing user interfaces in a more natural way than the
classic wall of text associated with the native code-behind
approach.
